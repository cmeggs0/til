# Why do we do code review?
- We think it is about finding bugs
- Real Reasons:
  1. Knowledge Transfer 
  2. Increased Team Awareness
  3. Finding alternative solutions
- The discipline of discussing your code with your peers
- The aforementioned benefits come when there is a strong code review culture
## Rules of engagement
- As an author, provide excellent context around our change - bring the reviewer up to speed. Rule of thumb, add 2 paragraphs around every change that you make
- As a reviewer, ask don't tell. Negatitivity bias in written communication. Overcome this by offering compliments, but then ask questions rather than make demands when need to be critical.
  - Did you consider...?
  - Can you clarify...?
- Make sure the questions don't impart judgement value, avoid "Why didn't you just...?"
- Utilize the Socratic Method for Code Review
### Conflict
- We don't agree on the issue
  - Agree to disagree  
- We don't agree on the process
  - Getting the team involved
### What to Review
